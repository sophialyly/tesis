Description: Various z3c.form date and datetime widgets
        ==========================================
        
        Improved datetime widgets for z3c.form
        
            When the emphasis of the application you are designing is on speed and
            speed alone, then the single field pattern might be your friend. It's
            particularly useful for data entry applications in which the person
            who has to enter the data will have to use the same input form time
            and time again. 
        
        .. _Date Input Diversity: http://www.cornae.org/articles/date-input-diversity
        
        
        The ``collective.z3cform.datetimewidget`` library provides a form framework
        and widgets. This document ensures that we implement a widget for Date and
        Datetime field defined in ``zope.schema``. Take a look at the different widget 
        doctest files for more information about the widgets.

           After some testing I have seen that some validations are missing, therefore
           I get an error when adding values like '99' into the year field:
           "ValueError: year=99 is before 1900; the datetime strftime() methods require
           year >= 1900"
