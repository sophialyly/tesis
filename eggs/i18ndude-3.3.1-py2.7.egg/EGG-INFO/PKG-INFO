Description: i18ndude
        ========
        
        .. contents::
        
        
        Compatibility
        -------------
        
        i18ndude works with Python 2.6 and 2.7.  It is expected to work with
        Python 2.4 and 2.5 too, but it may be tricky to get the proper
        versions of its dependencies that work with those Python versions.
        
        i18ndude uses a few zope packages.  If you install i18ndude using a
        buildout, you may want to pin their versions to the ones in the
        current latest ztk (Zope Tool Kit) versions, as that is what we test
        with:
        http://download.zope.org/zopetoolkit/index/1.1.6/ztk-versions.cfg
        
        If you add i18ndude to a buildout that handles a Zope, CMF or Plone
        site, you probably already have versions pinned so then you do not
        need to add an ``extends`` line.
        
        You can also use ``pip`` or ``easy_install`` to install it.  With
        ``pip`` you may want to create a ``requirements.txt`` based on that
        ztk versions list.
        
        Command line interface
        ======================
        
        These are the various command line options.

        i18ndude
        --------
        
        ::
        
          usage: i18ndude [-h]
                          
                          {find-untranslated,rebuild-pot,merge,sync,filter,admix,list,trmerge}
                          ...
        
          i18ndude performs various tasks related to ZPT's, Python Scripts
          and i18n.
        
          Its main task is to extract translation strings (msgids) into a
          .pot file (with the 'rebuild-pot' command), and sync the .pot file
          with .po files (with the 'sync' command).
        
          Call i18ndude with one of the listed subcommands followed by
          --help to get help for that subcommand.
        
          optional arguments:
            -h, --help            show this help message and exit
        
          subcommands:
            {find-untranslated,rebuild-pot,merge,sync,filter,admix,list,trmerge}
        
        find-untranslated
        -----------------
        
        ::
        
          usage: i18ndude find-untranslated [-h] [-s] [-n] [files [files ...]]
        
              Provide a list of ZPT filenames and I will output a report of places
              where I suspect untranslated messages, i.e. tags for which
              "i18n:translate" or "i18n:attributes" are missing.
        
              If you provide the -s option, the report will only contain a summary
              of errors and warnings for each file (or no output if there are no
              errors or warnings). If you provide the -n option, the report will
              contain only the errors for each file.
              
        
          positional arguments:
            files            list of ZPT filenames
        
          optional arguments:
            -h, --help       show this help message and exit
            -s, --silent     The report will only contain a summary of errors and
                             warnings for each file (or no output if there are no errors
                             or warnings).
            -n, --nosummary  The report will contain only the errors for each file.
        
        rebuild-pot
        -----------
        
        ::
        
          usage: i18ndude rebuild-pot [-h] [--wrap | --no-wrap] [--width NUMBER] -p
                                      filename [-c domain] [-m filename]
                                      [--merge2 filename]
                                      [--exclude "<ignore1> <ignore2> ..."]
                                      [path [path ...]]
        
              Given a pot-file via the --pot option you can specify one or more
              directories which including all sub-folders will be searched for
              PageTemplates (*.*pt) and Python scripts (*.*py).
        
              Make sure you have a backup copy of the original pot-file in case
              you need to fill back in ids by hand.
        
              If you specify a domain in --create I will create the pot file and
              look for messages for that domain.  Otherwise I will take the
              domain from the Domain header in the given pot file and keep the
              headers from the file as base for a new pot file.
        
              If you give me an additional pot-file with the --merge <filename>
              option, I try to merge these msgids into the target-pot file
              afterwards. If a msgid already exists in the ones I found in the
              ZPTs, I'll warn you and ignore that msgid. I take the mime-header
              from this additional pot-file. If you provide a second pot-file via
              --merge2 <filename> I'll merge this into the first merge's result
        
              You can also provide a list of filenames which should not be included
              by using the --exclude argument, which takes a whitespace delimited
              list of files.
              
        
          positional arguments:
            path
        
          optional arguments:
            -h, --help            show this help message and exit
            --wrap                Wrap long lines.
            --no-wrap             Do not wrap long lines. This is the default.
            --width NUMBER        Set output page width. Default is 79.
            -p filename, --pot filename
            -c domain, --create domain
            -m filename, --merge filename
            --merge2 filename
            --exclude "<ignore1> <ignore2> ..."
        
        merge

          usage: i18ndude merge [-h] [--wrap | --no-wrap] [--width NUMBER] -p filename
                                -m filename [--merge2 filename]
        
              Given a pot-file via the --pot option and a second
              pot-file with the --merge <filename> option, I try to merge
              these msgids into the target-pot file. If a msgid already
              exists, I'll warn you and ignore that msgid.
        
              If you provide a --merge2 <filename> I'll first merge this one
              in addition to the first one.
              
        
          optional arguments:
            -h, --help            show this help message and exit
            --wrap                Wrap long lines.
            --no-wrap             Do not wrap long lines. This is the default.
            --width NUMBER        Set output page width. Default is 79.

                               pofilename [pofilename ...]
        
              Given a pot-file with the --pot option and a list of po-files I'll
              remove from the po files those message translations of which the
              msgids are not in the pot-file and add messages that the pot-file has
              but the po-file doesn't.
              
        
          positional arguments:
            pofilename
        
          optional arguments:

            --wrap                Wrap long lines.
            --no-wrap             Do not wrap long lines. This is the default.
            --width NUMBER        Set output page width. Default is 79.
            -p potfilename, --pot potfilename
        
        filter
        ------
        
        ::
        
          usage: i18ndude filter [-h] [--wrap | --no-wrap] [--width NUMBER] file1 file2
        
              Given two pot-files I will write a copy of file1 to stdout with all
              messages removed that are also in file2, i.e. where msgids match.
              
        
          positional arguments:
            file1
            file2
        
          optional arguments:
            -h, --help      show this help message and exit
            --wrap          Wrap long lines.
            --no-wrap       Do not wrap long lines. This is the default.
            --width NUMBER  Set output page width. Default is 79.
        
        admix
        -----
        
        ::
        
          usage: i18ndude admix [-h] [--wrap | --no-wrap] [--width NUMBER] file1 file2
        
              Given two po-files I will look for translated entries in file2 that
              are untranslated in file1. I add these translations (msgstrs) to
              file1. Note that this will not affect the number of entries in file1.
              The result will be on stdout.
              
        
          positional arguments:
            file1
            file2
        
          optional arguments:

        ::
        
          usage: i18ndude list [-h] -p product [product ...] [-t]
        
              This will create a simple listing that displays how much of the
              combined products pot's is translated for each language. Run this
              from the directory containing the pot-files. The product name is
              normally a domain name.
              
        
          optional arguments:
            -h, --help            show this help message and exit

          usage: i18ndude trmerge [-h] [--wrap | --no-wrap] [--width NUMBER] file1 file2
        
              Given two po-files I will update all translations from file2 into
              file1. Missing translations are added.
              If a translation was fuzzy in file1, and there is a nonempty translation
              in file2, the fuzzy marker is removed.
              The result will be on stdout.
              
        
          positional arguments:

            --wrap          Wrap long lines.
            --no-wrap       Do not wrap long lines. This is the default.
            --width NUMBER  Set output page width. Default is 79.
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        3.3.1 (2013-10-18)
        ------------------
        
        - Nothing changed yet.
        
        
        3.3.0 (2013-10-13)
        ------------------
        
        - Add command line documentation to long description of package.
          [maurits]
        
        - Add options ``--wrap``, ``--no-wrap`` and ``--width=NUMBER`` to all
          commands that write files.  Use these to determine whether long
          lines are wrapped and at which width.  Default width is 79.  By
          default we do NOT wrap, because we have never wrapped before.  This
          may change in the future, so if you *really* want to be sure to not
          wrap when using a future i18ndude version, you can add ``--no-wrap``
          now.
          https://github.com/collective/i18ndude/issues/3
          [maurits]
        
        - Fix the ``list`` command to also work in a ``locales`` structure.
          [maurits]
        
        - Fix an error in the ``merge`` command where the ``--merge`` option
          would be used as value for the ``--merge2`` option as well, if that
          option itself was unused.  This led to unneeded warnings.
          [maurits]
        
        - The ``--create domain`` option of ``rebuild-pot`` is now optional.
          If not given, i18ndude reads the domain from the given ``.pot``
          file.  It was always optional, but the documentation did not show it
          and it did not work.
          [maurits]
        
        - Update the command line options handling.  You can now get the help
          for individual commands by calling them with the ``--help`` option.
          [maurits]
        
        - Return exit code 1 when the called function gives an error.  This
          currently only has an effect when calling ``find-untranslated``.
          https://github.com/collective/i18ndude/issues/1
          [maurits]
        
        - Moved code to https://github.com/collective/i18ndude
          [maurits]
        
        - Backslash escape added to msgid when it includes double quotes.
          [taito]
        
        - Add trmerge command to merge po files. Custom tailored for transifex.
          [do3cc]
        
        
        3.2.2 (2010-12-11)
        ------------------
        
        - Encode key to utf-8 for the Merge-Warning message to avoid a
          UnicodeEncodeError.
          [mikerhodes]
        
        
        3.2.1 (2010-10-31)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed making POT file for DOUBLE BYTE strings on default.
          [terapyon]
        
        
        3.2 (2010-09-04)
        ----------------
        
        - Replaced internal odict implementation by the ordereddict package.
          (implementation backported from Python 2.7)
          [vincentfretin]
        
        
        3.1.3 (2010-09-04)
        ------------------
        
        - Avoid UnicodeDecodeError when printing warning message in add().
          [rnix]
        
        
        3.1.2 (2010-02-14)
        ------------------
        
        - elementtree is only required for Python < 2.5.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        - Fixed tests (patch provided by John Trammell).
          [vincentfretin]
        
        
        3.1.1 (2009-11-22)
        ------------------
        
        - Strip "src" only once in the pathname for the comments.
          Example: before it generated the following comment
          "#: archetypes.referencebrowserwidget/"
          which was not so useful. Now it generates
          "archetypes.referencebrowserwidget/src/archetypes/referencebrowserwidget/..."
          [vincentfretin]
        
        
        3.1 (2009-10-31)
        ----------------
        
        - Support for explicit msgids in GSReader.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        - Better handling of msgid references. Keep all the references in PTReader
          and PYReader. In POWriter, normalize and sort the references, write only
          MAX_OCCUR (default is 3) references.
          You can set MAX_OCCUR=None if you want all references to be written to
          the generated POT file. Only the first reference is written in case of
          several references to the same file but with different line number.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        - Depend now on zope.tal 3.5.2 to print a warning when msgid already exists
          in catalog with a different default message. Simplified PTReader code.
          Check for msgid with different default in GSReader, PYReader and in the
          merged catalog (ptctl, pyctl, gsctl).
          [vincentfretin]
        
        - Fix behaviour when dealing with broken xml files to be parsed.
          [afd]
        
        
        3.0 (2008-11-13)
        ----------------
        
        - No changes.
          [hannosch]
